# Jetson Initial Setup Tutorial
!warning This is only if you are flashing the Jetson for the first time, because every data that you have in here will be erased completely, this is only for the first time.

!note The connection between the Jetson and the robot computer is by micro usb.

To begin with this tutorial you must have installed the NVIDIA SDK Manager and also have your Jetson in Force Recovery Mode, if you haven't done that you can go and see the [README](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_tool_share/blob/feature/jetson_tutorials/tool_share/jetson_orin_agx_mount/tutorials/README.md) file and then come back.

Once the SDK Manager it’s installed and already running you’ll need to select the appropriate login tab.

Once you log in it will show you the step by step tutorial that you need to follow, we recommend that you have the latest version of jetpack installed and it depends if you want to disable the Host Machine button or the Additional SDKS button.
