## Stretch Teleop Kit

**Created by**: Hello Robot Inc

The Stretch Teleop Kit allows for improved remote teleoperation of Stretch. It adds two fish-eye USB cameras to Stretch. One is added to the robot's gripper for a better view while manipulating. The other is added to the robot's head and points downward, providing a better view while navigating.

Hello Robot provides an open-source teleoperation interface (beta) that utilizes these cameras. The code and its use can be found [here](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_fisheye_web_interface)

The Stretch RE1 URDF can be augmented with these two cameras as well. The URDF xacro is found here. To install:

```foo```



The Stretch Teleop Kit is available for sale by Hello Robot. Alternatively, it the STL files, BOM, and assembly instructions are available if you chose to build your own.
