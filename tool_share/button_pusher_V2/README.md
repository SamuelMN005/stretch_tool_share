## Button Pusher

**Create by**: Hello Robot Inc. and Henry Evans

A simple part to help Stretch push buttons or anything else you can imagine. The concave shape is designed to avoid blocking the gripper teleop camera, allowing for high-percision and easy use.

We found adding a layer of Dycem non-slip material helped with a more secure grip on the tool. Foam or cardboard blocks under each gripper pad may help stabilize as well.
