## Assembly instructions

1. Cut an approximately 6 inch diameter circle out of the foam. Slice around the perimiter about 2 inches into the foam to create a slot to hold cards.  

2. Gently press the spikes on the wheel into the center of the foam circle.

3. With the foam secured onto the wheel, connect the 5 printed pieces as seen in the exploded view, no adhesives or fastners required. The teeth on the pull tab should interlock with the teeth on the wheel gear so pulling and pushing the tab spins the wheel.
