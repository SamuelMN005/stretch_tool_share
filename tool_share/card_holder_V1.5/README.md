## Assembly instructions

1. Cut an approximately 6 inch diameter circle out of the foam. Slice around the perimiter about 2 inches into the foam to create a slot to hold cards.  
2. Gently press the spikes on the front of the gear wheel into the center of the foam circle. Push the axel on the A frame through the hole in the back of the wheel gear and into the foam until the back of the wheel gear meets the front of the A frame. 

3. With the foam and gear wheel secured onto the A frame, push the frame into the openings on the base.

4. Slide the pull tab into the slot on the A Frame. The teeth on the pull tab should interlock with the teeth on the wheel gear so pulling and pushing the tab spins the wheel.
