## Overview

We designed Stretch's hardware to be easily extended. You can make your own tool and attach it to the wrist to creatively expand what the Stretch RE1 can do. Your tool can also use Dynamixel X-series servos from Robotis via the provided TTL bus. 

In this repository, we provide examples of tools that we've created. We've released them with a permissive Apache 2.0 license, so you're free to use them as you wish. We hope they'll inspire you to create your own tools.

We also include URDF and mesh files for many of the tools in the [stretch_description](./stretch_description) folder. See the [Stretch ROS](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_ros/tree/master/stretch_description) documentation for guidance on integrating these tools into your robot model.

We'd love it if you shared your creations with the community. We recommend you create a GitHub repository similar to this one for your own tools and then post an announcement to the [forum](https://forum.hello-robot.com/) to let people know about it.
